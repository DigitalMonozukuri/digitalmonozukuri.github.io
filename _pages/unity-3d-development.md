			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				Unity is a cross-platform game engine with a built-in IDE developed by Unity Technologies. It is used to develop video games for web plugins, desktop platforms, consoles and mobile devices. It grew from an OS X supported game development tool in 2005 to a multi-platform game engine.

				As its name suggests, Unity 3D Game development means creating three-dimensional games that are appealing to play because they are so lifelike. The special effects rendered with Unity 3D can be so good that you can see the character’s face reflected on calm water while shadows seem to fall naturally behind the game characters. If you are attracted to creating your own 3D game, then you may need help from an experienced developer such as Digital Monozukuri. We can assist you from point A (game conceptualization) to point G (developing the actual game) to point Z (debugging and pilot testing your game). We can assume the load of developing in Unity game engine tools for you while you figure out what to do with your game once it has been released.
