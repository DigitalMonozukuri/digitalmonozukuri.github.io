			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				Games – the most engrossing activity in our daily lives. The main source of attraction in games is the challenge posed in front of the user and what makes it even more compelling is the ability to make it look real. High level graphics in most RPGs (Role Playing Games) with various characters keep the user magnetized to it. Characters are the most commonly used entities in even the most popular games like FIFA, NBA, Call of Duty etc. and with every update, they move a step closer to a virtual model of the actual character.
			</p>

			<p>
				Character creation is thus a very important aspect of games since the graphics of the character play a vital role in the success of the game. From a technical front, character creation involves deep artistic rendering of each element of the character and this is where you can substitute the true artists from the also-runs. Artistic talent cannot be undermined or learnt through videos or textual content. Along with artistic abilities, one also needs the technical development skills to develop these games.
