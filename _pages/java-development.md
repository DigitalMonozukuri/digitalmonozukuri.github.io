			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				The Java programming language is one of the most popularly used programming languages in the world today. With Java development lots of application programs can be installed easily on all computer architectures. This is one of the major advantages of the Java language over other programming languages.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another important factor that makes Java development a popular choice is that Java is now considered a FOSS or Free and Open Source Software, which means that anyone can download Java to make their own applications without having to pay licensing fees for its use.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, business enterprises are now using Java development to make their own applications, which is why Digital Monozukuri includes Java Development in their list of services.
			</p>

				If you as an enterprise, want a Java application developed for your company you can always inquire with us.
