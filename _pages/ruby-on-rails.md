			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				Ruby on Rails is based on the Ruby programming language. It is a web framework based on open source access. One of the greatest positives that Ruby on Rails development brings is that developing web applications can now be shortened to a few days (as earlier it used to take many weeks or even months, before web applications could be released in their final form).
			</p>
			<p>
				As Time is Money for all businesses, this means your business can deploy new products or services within a shorter window of time, thus giving you an edge over competitors who are still developing their business-based web applications. It also brings down the cost of developing web applications, especially if you used to pay web application developers by the hour or by the day for their services.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to do your own Ruby on Rails project, you own the business and leave the programming part to us!
