			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				For the newbies among us, PHP is a web development language that has been widely adopted for multiple websites throughout the world. It also has its uses in general programming functions. Literally millions of websites are now running on the PHP language which means that your e-commerce business may need to be founded on the PHP language as well to facilitate smooth operations with other PHP based websites. If you are looking for a developer to make a PHP-based web solution for you, Digital Monozukuri could be the right company for the job.

				Because PHP is an open-source code, you can actually have the source code for your site amended if necessary. You can do this code tweaking yourself or you can hire a more experienced developer for the job. Open source means any changes can be done without having to pay the owners of the PHP source code which is the PHP Group developer. You probably will easily be able to find a web hosting provider that can support your PHP-based website.
			</p>

				Another side benefit of switching to PHP code is that it can accommodate web content management systems founded on PHP. Your e-commerce system might be using Joomla! for example so you will be pleased to know that Joomla! is compatible with your PHP-based site. Another commonly used web content management system is Moodle which also happens to work well with a PHP-based website. Many e-commerce businesses do need some kind of web content management system so it is best to choose one that will work smoothly on your PHP coded website for the long term. Otherwise you may need help from a developer to figure out the technical issues that are in the way.
