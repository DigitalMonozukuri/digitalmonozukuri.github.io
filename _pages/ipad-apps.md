			<h3>Overview</h3>

			You're most likely familiar with an iPad. An iPad can shoot video, take photos, play music, and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions—games, reference, GPS navigation, social networking, etc.—can be enabled by downloading and installing apps. As of October 2013, the App Store has more than 475,000 native apps by Apple and third parties, currently the largest app store.

			Obviously if you intend to target the mass market for your app, your app has to provide a necessary service that other apps cannot offer. For example, if you are targeting the college student market then how could your app help them do better as they study? One nice idea is a debt management app because student debt is a growing problem in many college campuses. This means that app would help college students manage debt payments regularly so that they get alerts well in advance and don’t forget to make payments to creditors before due dates arrive.
