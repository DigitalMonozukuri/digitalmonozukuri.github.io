			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				The Dot Net system is a software framework. It runs on the Windows operating system of Microsoft but is unique because it is compatible over a range of different programming languages. This means that you can run .Net on any of those programming languages without worrying that the code will be rejected. Various types of applications can be created using the Dot Net platform. Some of them are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Customer Relationship Management</li>
				<li>Accounting Applications</li>
				<li>Web Sites</li>
				<li>XML Web services</li>
				<li>Product/Inventory Applications</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Dot Net also provides a standardized security structure for each and every application.
			</p>
			<p>
				One reason you may need the assistance of Digital Monozukuri is that there are parts of the .Net Framework that are not open source – rather Microsoft retained ownership over the source code covered by the Microsoft Reference License except when used for debugging purposes. Get help from our programmers to find ways to use the .Net Framework legally and legitimately.
