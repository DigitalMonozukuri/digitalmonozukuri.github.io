			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				Windows Phones are the mobile devices extravagantly operated by Microsoft. The latest version Windows Phone 8/8.1 has been pushed to all mobile systems operating Windows.
			</p>

			<p>
				Windows does not have a fair share in the market of mobile devices due to the lack of availability of features and applications converse to Android. This makes the Windows Phone platform a boon to developers who are new to the market. Due to this lack of services, Microsoft encourages developers to build on their platform and offer a more financially sound pay.
			</p>

			<p>
				Windows is most commonly lacking in gaming applications and a new launch in gaming is a big hit. We recommend a gaming application for the platform and we can help you out with your idea to bring it to the market.
			</p>
