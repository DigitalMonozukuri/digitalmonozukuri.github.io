			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>
				Developing Android Application is important if you intend to get involved in the smartphone market. Android is the most extensively used mobile operating system worldwide and currently surpasses Windows, iOS and Mac OS devices combined in sales. Being open source makes it even more feasible to developers and small enterprises.
			</p>

			<p>
				The best thing about developing your own Android app is that it may become hugely popular with tablet and smartphone owners everywhere. Of course, this is not a sure thing â€“ there are many Android apps that are gathering dust online while others are runaway hits that have helped their developers rake in profits. Like many business activities, there are risks involved when you release a new app into the market. For this reason, you should not believe anyone who says he or they can guarantee the success of your app because the reality is there is no such guarantee. So be sure you are aware of the gamble you are taking by developing a new Android app at this time. Digital monozukuri is one company that can assist you in making Android apps.
